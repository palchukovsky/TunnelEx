The following is applicable to ACE library:

[1]ACE(TM), [2]TAO(TM), [3]CIAO(TM), and [4]CoSMIC(TM) (henceforth referred to
as "DOC software") are copyrighted by [5]Douglas C. Schmidt and his [6]research
group at [7]Washington University, [8]University of California, Irvine, and
[9]Vanderbilt University, Copyright (c) 1993-2005, all rights reserved. Since
DOC software is open-source, freely available software, you are free to use,
modify, copy, and distribute--perpetually and irrevocably--the DOC software
source code and object code produced from the source, as well as copy and
distribute modified versions of this software. You must, however, include this
copyright statement along with code built using DOC software.

You can use DOC software in commercial and/or binary software releases and are
under no obligation to redistribute any of your source code that is built using
DOC software. Note, however, that you may not do anything to the DOC software
code, such as copyrighting it yourself or claiming authorship of the DOC software
code, that will prevent DOC software from being distributed freely using an
open-source development model. You needn't inform anyone that you're using DOC
software in your software, though we encourage you to let [10]us know so we can
promote your project in the [11]DOC software success stories.

The [12]ACE, [13]TAO, [14]CIAO, and [15]CoSMIC web sites are maintained by the
[16]DOC Group at the [17]Institute for Software Integrated Systems (ISIS) and the
[18]Center for Distributed Object Computing of Washington University, St. Louis
for the development of open-source software as part of the open-source software
community. By submitting comments, suggestions, code, code snippets, techniques
(including that of usage) and algorithms (collectively ``Submissions''),
submitters acknowledge that they have the right to do so, that any such
Submissions are given freely and unreservedly, and that they waive any claims to
copyright or ownership. In addition, submitters acknowledge that any such
Submission might become part of the copyright maintained on the overall body of
code that comprises the DOC software. By making a Submission, submitter agree to
these terms. Moreover, submitters acknowledge that the incorporation or
modification of such Submissions is entirely at the discretion of the moderators
of the open-source DOC software projects or their designees.

Submissions are provided by the submitter ``as is'' with no warranties whatsoever,
including any warranty of merchantability, noninfringement of third party
intellectual property, or fitness for any particular purpose. In no event shall
the submitter be liable for any direct, indirect, special, exemplary, punitive,
or consequential damages, including without limitation, lost profits, even if
advised of the possibility of such damages. Likewise, DOC software is provided
as is with no warranties of any kind, including the warranties of design,
merchantability, and fitness for a particular purpose, noninfringement, or
arising from a course of dealing, usage or trade practice. Washington University,
UC Irvine, Vanderbilt University, their employees, and students shall have no
liability with respect to the infringement of copyrights, trade secrets or any
patents by DOC software or any part thereof. Moreover, in no event will
Washington University, UC Irvine, or Vanderbilt University, their employees, or
students be liable for any lost revenue or profits or other special, indirect
and consequential damages.

DOC software is provided with no support and without any obligation on the part
of Washington University, UC Irvine, Vanderbilt University, their employees, or
students to assist in its use, correction, modification, or enhancement. A
[19]number of companies around the world provide commercial support for DOC
software, however.

DOC software is Y2K-compliant, as long as the underlying OS platform is
Y2K-compliant. Likewise, DOC software is compliant with the new US daylight
savings rule passed by Congress as "The Energy Policy Act of 2005," which
established new daylight savings times (DST) rules for the United States that
expand DST as of March 2007. Since DOC software obtains time/date and
calendaring information from operating systems users will not be affected by the
new DST rules as long as they upgrade their operating systems accordingly.

The names ACE(TM), TAO(TM), CIAO(TM), CoSMIC(TM), Washington University,
UC Irvine, and Vanderbilt University, may not be used to endorse or promote
products or services derived from this source without express written permission
from Washington University, UC Irvine, or Vanderbilt University. Further,
products or services derived from this source may not be called ACE(TM), TAO(TM),
CIAO(TM), or CoSMIC(TM) nor may the name Washington University, UC Irvine, or
Vanderbilt University appear in their names, without express written permission

If you have any suggestions, additions, comments, or questions, please let [20]me
know.
