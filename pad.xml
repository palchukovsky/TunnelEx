			<Char_Desc_450>TunnelEx is software designed to redirect data removing all the obstacles that can be thrown in its way, bypass firewalls and any restrictions imposed by the local security policy.

			<Char_Desc_2000>TunnelEx is software designed to redirect data removing all the obstacles that can be thrown in its way, bypass firewalls and any restrictions imposed by the local security policy. TunnelEx possesses a unique combination of features that support different data transfer protocols and allow integrating them. Among them there are most frequently used TCP, UDP, UPnP, FTP, named pipes and others.

Due to the availability of the Pathfinder feature it becomes even easier to use the program because it can automatically ask for a list of free public HTTP servers and build a tunnel through them, however when necessary users can identify a list of preferable servers.

In case a local security policy denies you an access to FTP servers the program can redirect data through HTTP proxy-servers because it provides FTP over HTTP.

It may seem that it is rather complicated to use this program but it operates automatically to such an extent that users can fully rely on it. They will not know that TunnelEx plays an intermediary role taking functions of the real FTP and HTTP servers.

This version also features HTTP tunneling from a proxy cascade ensuring that client applications from different networks will always be able to communicate with each other.

All these sophisticated functions are of particular interest for IT-programmers, system administrators and other IT-specialists but thanks to its friendly user interface the program can be useful for home-users as well.</Char_Desc_2000>
